## Preview
This flashcards game theme is "IU" k-pop superstar which is my idol

## Technology used
I used javascript, css and html.
I used some locally stored images and fonts.

## Approch
The main approch of this game is using css animation to flip a card and create a logic which is checking that the couple of card is matched or not

### How I solve for winner
The game will be ended when all the card is flipped and each matched card is flipped, the counter will be counted

## Main features
1. The timer
2. Input the player name
3. Record the player name

## User stories
#### MVP goal:
1. As a player, I would like my game to kept the card face up if it is flipped card is matched
2. As a player, if the selected couple of card is different, it must be flipped back
3. As a player, The game will be ended if all the card is revealed
4. As a player, I would like the card should have 2 side and there both should have image

#### Stretch goal:
1. As a player, the score should be record and rely on the time user used to ended the game and it should be recorded even the page is reloaded
2. As a player, they should be able to fill in their name for show up on the scoreboard
3. The card is shuffled when the game is reseted

## What left?
1. As a player, they should be able to select the game level
2. As a player, they should be able to use their keyboard to play game
